# Awesome Agentic ML [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Agentic ML refers to autonomous AI systems that can plan, execute, and iterate on machine learning workflows with minimal human intervention—from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Scope: What Counts as Agentic ML?

A resource belongs in this list when it demonstrates autonomous, closed-loop progress on machine learning workflows (not just general-purpose agent behavior).

**Inclusion checklist (meet at least 3 of 4):**

- Goal-directed ML planning (selects or revises strategy for an ML objective)
- Tool-using execution across ML lifecycle stages (data prep, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, experimentation)
- Iterative feedback loop (uses metrics/errors/results to revise actions)
- Empirical ML outcome (benchmark, competition result, ablation, or measurable improvement)

**Exclude or deprioritize:**

- Generic web/desktop/coding agents without meaningful ML workflow contribution
- Social-only announcements without a primary technical source (paper/repo/blog)
- Stale resources unless there is a substantive new release/update in the recent window

---

## Research Assistant Agent

This repository runs a weekly **Research Assistant Agent** via GitHub Actions to scout and triage potential additions.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/weekly-resource-research.yml`
- Primary curation model: `gpt-5.3-codex` with `xhigh` effort
- Default Grok scout model: `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` (override with `GROK_MODEL` repository variable)
- Signal sources: xAI Grok social scout + arXiv RSS scout + Codex curation pass

**Behavior:**

- If high-confidence additions are found, the agent updates `README.md` and opens a draft PR with a supporting suggestion log.
- If no high-confidence additions are found, the agent opens an issue log with the weekly scout outputs (instead of forcing changes).
- The agent applies the inclusion checklist in this README and avoids generic non-ML-workflow agent news.
