# Harness Engineering [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Harness engineering covers the design and implementation of the scaffolding, execution environments, and control infrastructure that host AI agents—the layer between the model and the world that manages the agent loop, tool dispatch, context, state, safety constraints, and observability.

## Scope: What Counts as Harness Engineering?

A resource belongs here when it substantively addresses the *infrastructure* layer of agent execution, not just the agent's reasoning or application logic.

**Inclusion checklist (meet at least 3 of 4):**

- Defines or implements the execution loop, scaffolding, or runtime environment that hosts an AI agent
- Manages tool dispatch, context handling, state management, or safety constraints at the harness layer
- Evaluates or benchmarks agent behavior through controlled harness-mediated interactions
- Empirical or production evidence of harness design improving reliability, safety, or performance

**Exclude or deprioritize:**

- Agent application logic unrelated to the hosting infrastructure (e.g., pure prompt engineering)
- Generic CI/CD or test frameworks not specific to AI agent execution
- Social-only announcements without a primary technical source (paper/repo/blog)
- Stale resources unless there is a substantive new release/update in the recent window

## Research Assistant Agent

This repository runs a weekly **Research Assistant Agent** via GitHub Actions to scout and triage potential additions.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/weekly-resource-research.yml`
- Default Grok scout model: `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` (override with `GROK_MODEL` repository variable)
- Signal sources: xAI Grok social scout + arXiv RSS scout + Claude curation pass

**Behavior:**

- If high-confidence additions are found, the agent updates `README.md` and opens a draft PR with a supporting suggestion log.
- If no high-confidence additions are found, the agent opens an issue log with the weekly scout outputs (instead of forcing changes).
- The agent applies the inclusion checklist above and avoids resources focused only on model capabilities without harness-layer contributions.
