# Awesome Agentic Workflow Design [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Agentic workflow design and practices covers architectural patterns, design principles, and engineering practices for building reliable, production-grade agentic systems—from single-agent pipelines to multi-agent orchestration.

## Scope: What Counts as Agentic Workflow Design?

A resource belongs in this list when it addresses the design, architecture, or engineering practices for agentic systems in a substantive, principled way.

**Inclusion checklist (meet at least 3 of 4):**

- Architectural guidance for goal-directed agent systems (patterns, orchestration, state management)
- Tool-use and execution design across agent lifecycle stages (planning, execution, feedback, recovery)
- Iterative refinement practices (evaluation loops, human-in-the-loop, observability)
- Empirical or practical grounding (case studies, benchmarks, production deployment evidence)

**Exclude or deprioritize:**

- Generic LLM tutorials without agentic design focus
- Social-only announcements without a primary technical source (paper/repo/blog)
- Stale resources unless there is a substantive new release/update in the recent window

## Research Assistant Agent

This repository runs a weekly **Research Assistant Agent** via GitHub Actions to scout and triage potential additions.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/weekly-resource-research.yml`
- Primary curation model: `gpt-5.3-codex` with `xhigh` effort
- Default Grok scout model: `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` (override with `GROK_MODEL` repository variable)
- Signal sources: xAI Grok social scout + arXiv RSS scout + Codex curation pass
